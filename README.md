# bigfoot.js prepared by team 6

This is an enhanced version of the original Bigfoot.js library, with several modifications to improve functionality and appearance.

## Key Changes

1. **Build Process**: Replaced Grunt with npm for a more modern build workflow. The `package.json` file has been updated to reflect these changes.

2. **Styling**: Modified the CSS to change the appearance of footnotes. The new style provides a cleaner, more modern look that better integrates with contemporary web designs.

3. **Footnote Behavior**: Altered the footnote display behavior. Now, footnotes appear from the side of the page for each tab, providing a smoother and less intrusive user experience.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
5. then run:
   ```bash
   npm run build

## Custom Styling

The footnotes now slide in from the side of the page. This is achieved through CSS modifications in the `bigfoot-default.css` file. You can further customize this behavior by adjusting the CSS rules.

## Notes for Contributors

If you're contributing to this project, please note that we're using npm scripts instead of Grunt. Familiarize yourself with the scripts section in `package.json` before making changes.
